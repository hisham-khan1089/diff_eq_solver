# First Order Differential Equation Solver

diff_eq_solver.py is a simple script that takes a first-order differential equation of the form dy/dx = f(x,y)
and solves it numerically. 

The goal of this project was to compare some numerical methods (Euler's, Improved Euler's, RK4) side-by-side
on real differential equations to see how they diverge.
